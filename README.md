# 🌿 Hello! I'm Sami 👋

I'm a Machine Learning professional focused on computer vision. I specialize in training object detection models using YOLO and Detectron2. I create my own datasets, experiment with different augmentation strategies, and fine-tune training for each use case.

I currently use tools like FiftyOne, CLIP, and FAISS to improve dataset quality and build semantic search systems. I'm interested in combining traditional computer vision techniques with new generative and embedding-based approaches.

I run my experiments locally on a Predator Helios 18 with an RTX 4090, training YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLOv11, and Detectron2 models — depending on the requirements of each project.

## 🔧 What I use daily

- YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLOv11
- Detectron2
- FiftyOne
- CLIP + FAISS
- CVAT
- Python + CUDA
- Google Colab + JupyterLab
- Stable Diffusion (for dataset augmentation)

## 🧪 What I'm building right now

- An object detection model for **medicinal herbs sold at CEAGESP** (São Paulo's major produce market)
- A workflow combining **YOLOv11 + CLIP + FiftyOne** for dataset curation and image validation
- A system for **semantic image search** using **CLIP embeddings** + **FAISS**
- A local training pipeline with **Weights & Biases** integration for tracking and visualization

## ❤️ What keeps me moving (literally)

I'm a runner, weightlifter and jiu-jitsu enthusiast. While recovering from an injury, I’m focusing on light morning training, mobility work, and visualizing my movements until I can fully return to the mats. My body is strong, and I’m committed to moving — every single day.
